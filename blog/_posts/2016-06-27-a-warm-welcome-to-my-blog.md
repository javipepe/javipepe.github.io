Greetings!

Hello! Thanks for stumbling across my blog. While I created this fun the fun of doing a dynamic page in Github Pages and to very occasionally express my feelings towards certain motto, it will also contain tutorials or step-by-step guides on tech-geek things I consider important or simply things that I feel are different-to-the-rest enough that deserve a blog post on their own. Even so I don't know and therefore I can't promise how active it'll be, just as I can't know when ideas or inspiration itself will pop up in my mind.

Although you probably come from there already, my main website is <a href="https://javipepe.pw">javipepe.pw</a>, so you can check that out to know a bit more about me and to contact me, if that's your purpose. That's all I have for today.

Thanks a lot for dropping by!

Regards,
Javi
